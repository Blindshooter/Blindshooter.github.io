## My experience

Currently I am leading Execution Data Science team at DataRobot, where I work (and have some fun) for the last 6 years. The team is focused on delivering end-to-end projects that require both technical aptitude and business acumen to ensure the success of our clients. 

Besides that I am leading Data Science educational division in Projector (I explain in details what and why we do that [here](https://prjctr.com/mag/ds_zavkaf) in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦). 

I will be also mentoring data scientists and other IT professionals [here](https://mentory.v-tylu.com/en/oleksandrr) and I am looking forward to it.
