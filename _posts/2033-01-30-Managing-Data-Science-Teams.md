## 0. The reason for this post

Recently I got an email with the job posting that got me interested. Now, it doesn't happen very often, but when it does, I use it as a reality check - what I should have known by now to land this job if I wanted. The position was for a person that will build and lead the whole Data Science consultancy division in one big consultancy firm. You may know the name. Anyway, not sure if it is ethical to mention the name of the firm but also it doesn't matter much. 

This position I believed was an upgrade from what I do now (leading a service team) but I felt that the current circumstances (mass layoffs) in the tech industry are not favorable to change the place of work and also I am a great believer in DataRobot product. So I decided that instead I can imagine that I am hired to build the team from scratch alongside infrastructure around the team, hone the sales process and ensure that we are profitable, beating all the profitability benchmarks and earning love and money. This is how this blog emerged as a place to share my thoughts and experience but also theorize  on the things I haven't encountered just yet. 

Leading the big team is overwhelming escpecially if you are hired from the outside. If you are a home-grown promoted manager you should be aware of  internal politics, short pathways and possible pitfalls. At the same time, not only the team matters but the way you are doing business - how you find your clients, win them over, deliver the use case and make your client succesful. If you are working in a product company - you need to treat your stakeholders as clients so there will be small difference from consultancy. Here I've listed all the stuff a Data Science Manager need to ba aware of or deal with and will be covering them in more details later



## 1. Your team

##### Your manager (managing up)
New to the company or not - communication with your direct manager oftentimes is your first priority. 

##### Team composition

##### Your allies, your friends, your opposition
Knowledge is the source of the power. And 

## 2. Your Data Science Practice

##### Quick iterations (AutoML)

##### Your codebase

##### Your infrastructure (security, data storage)


## 3. Your Sales

##### How to work with your Sales team. 

##### Pitch decks and their importance

##### Packaging your offer

##### Pricing


## Your pre-sales
Difference from usual IT development
##### Why need POV

##### What requirements of succesful POV

##### Bake off or no?

## 4. Your Delivery

##### The SOW

##### Delivery of what is promised

##### Project creep


## 5. Support

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $49   |

And footnotes[^1], which link to explanations[^2] at the bottom[^4] of the page[^3].

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/203710832" width="640" height="288" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
