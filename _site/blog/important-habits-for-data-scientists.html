<p>##</p>

<p>[toc]</p>

<p>(If you don’t want to read a long intro - feel free to click on table of contents to jump further.)</p>

<p>First of all, this post is not GPT generated. The pictures are credit to midjourney, but writing is not. It could have been though, but I decided to do it myself to develop my writing habit. I’ve enjoyed writing and at some point, I thought that a journalist career is ahead of me but my teachers and my peers gently guided me on another path - math, physics, alcohol consumption, actuarial science, and eventually data science. I’ve been trying to keep writing about topics of different importance but all of these scribblings went into a desk drawer.</p>

<p>On February 24th, russia invaded my country. I was on a business trip, so I couldn’t return home safely.  I recognize my fortune in being able to stay abroad as there are thousands of people who would envy my situation. But at the same time during the first year since the invasion I’ve lived in 6 different apartments in 5 countries.</p>

<p>With all this stress I forgot about  my usual duties - family and work. I quickly noticed that my productivity had diminished dramatically. There was a stress, yes, but most of my habits were gone. I couldn’t concentrate, was reading the news and discussing them with friends and colleagues, and I was procrastinating the rest of the time. After 5 months I decided to take back control of my life. I’ve asked myself - if I am starting from this low, where my priorities should go? Where should I put my efforts first and in which habits and processes? I analyzed the most important habits for the data scientist and decided to share my findnings. I’ve split them in technical and non-technical categories for more convenience. But first things first.</p>

<h3 id="0-knowing-yourself">0. Knowing yourself</h3>

<p>There is an important prerequisite that people always forget about and keep wondering why after perfectly following somebody’s advice, they still come up short of their goals. I am an adamant advocate of the view that knowing yourself and understanding how your mind and body works is of utmost importance before trying to prioritize and develop your habits.</p>

<p>Everybody is different. Some wake up early to tackle most tedious tasks even before having breakfast, some are insanely focused around the midnight and tend to work until 2-3 am. Some embrace chaos and are most creative when are not restricted by a routine, others need to have a day planned by hour to achieve peak performance. If you’ll look around for succesful people that you know, you will see that their success is not tied to some specific habit but rather to ability to dedicate a lot of time to the task at hand. That is why I want to emphasize - those differences are neither good or bad in isolation, but you need to know how your brain and body is functioning in different circumstances. How stress resilient are you, which time of the day/week/year you are able to perform better or worse, what level of supervision you need, what environment helps you concentrate better. So you need to know what drives you, what brings you to a “flow” state, what motivates you and entices your curiosity.</p>

<p>Now, fair question is what to do next if you don’t know all of that? Well, you should figure that out by putting yourself in different situations and be mindful about what is going on with you. You are a data scientist, right, it is all about experimentation and some of your hyperparameter tuning. Knowing yourself is important to a data scientist as any other person who wants to achieve great results in what they are doing. But besides that -  here are some habits more specific to a data professionals.</p>

<h3 id="non-technical-habits">Non-Technical habits</h3>

<h3 id="1-reading-one-data-science-material-a-day">1. Reading one data science material a day</h3>
<p>Maybe you are already getting paid for reading research papers. If yes - good for you, you can have this checkbox crossed out. For others, I want to emphasize the importance of doing so. Yes, not only papers, but blogs as well, maybe even watching some videos will do the trick for you. The main goal is to stay connected.</p>

<p>Recent advances in content generation are really inspiring and it is good to have a general understanding how they work. But if you are not in that business just yet, there can be tons of materials for various topics like interpretability, model bias and fairness, MLOps.</p>

<p><strong>How it helped me?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I became more knowledgable about data science</li>
  <li>I got good ideas for some of my existing projects or even long-abandoned ones</li>
  <li>Motivated me to continue growing as a data scientist</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-track-your-wins">2. Track your wins</h3>
<p>It is a good practice to notice what have you done this week or month. If you or your manager set your OKRs (new fancy word for goals), than when the times come to check their achievement it may be hard to remember all the details of the project you did for example 2 months ago. So you will have to spend a lot of time finding some specific details or particular metrics you wanted or agreed to achieve. In contrast, keeping notes like  Wins of the week or Wins of the month will help you a lot in that regard.</p>

<p>Not only that - but depending how compensation review in your company is performed, you can talk to your manager and justify your raise. Besides that do you remember the mantra of all the articles about how to construct your CV? Like you have to mention goals you have achieved. So you are not enough appreciated in your current job, then some of this notes can be used in your CV to attract potential employers. If you are looking into a particular framework how to exactly <em>keep track</em> of your wins then <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method">here</a> is a good article on how to <em>present</em> your wins yousing STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method</p>

<p><strong>How it helped me?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kept me motivated to acgieve something meaningful by the end of the cycle so the Wins section is not empty</li>
  <li>I became more mindful about even small achievements as they can snowball into something bigger later</li>
  <li>As a manager not only I keep track of <em>my</em> wins, I also store screenshots from slack and emails about people in my team. This helps me to be prepared in advance if they come asking for a raise.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-master-your-calendar">3. Master your calendar</h3>
<p>Your calendar can be your ally and can be your enemy. I have seen people thinking that coming to a new company it should be them fully adjust to the calendars of their colleagues and make themselfes available for  calls and meetings 24/7. Instead you should find a balance between corporate culture and your free time. Don’t worry about missing out some important meeting, let the owner of the meeting figure out how to accomodate everybody - worst case scenario they will ask you directly if the timeslot at 2 am your time works for you.</p>

<p>It is not technically a habit, mastering your calendar is a skill, but it helps you develop some good habits. Here are some tips on how to master your calendar:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Block some time when you will not have any meetings under any circumstances. This time should be for your focus work purpose, nothing else. Depends on what time of the day you are feeling most productive.</li>
  <li>You can plan your week in calendar creating blocks that are dedicated to the specific type of work you are going to do. Just don’t make it look cluttered.</li>
  <li>If you are working in the international team. Google calendar allows you to set your working hours, so you should  do just that. It doesn’t prevent people scheduling meeting for this time, but usually only really important ones</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How it helped me?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced meetings time outside of my working hours to a minimum</li>
  <li>Allowed me to have uninterrupted mornings</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-taking-notes">4. Taking Notes</h3>
<p>It takes sometimes months for projects from the start to actual take off and to the final delivery.  Sometimes project become dormant for a while to be ressurected in a least convenient time. And now you have to remember what was already discussed, why certain decision were made and should we even proceed further. Countless times I have seen project’s discussions resurface and after hours of meetings just to figure out that nothing really have changed and there is no point to revive it.</p>

<p>Taking notes is actually a habit where doing bad is way better then doing nothing. For example, I am taking notes by hand on a paper in a physical notebook and I would say that it is still hard to find something in it after several months. But it is possible. And then you have your whole history of communication at hand so you will not waste time on trying to remember some details from the past</p>

<p>So long story short - ensure that on important meetings somebody is taking notes - either you or delegate it to somebody else if you are for example making presentation.</p>

<p><strong>How it helped me?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Helped track statuses across many projects I manage</li>
  <li>Reviewing the notes can help generate additional ideas or raise important follow up questions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="non-technical-habits-1">Non-Technical habits</h3>

<h3 id="1-experiment-tracking">1. Experiment tracking</h3>

<h3 id="2-writing-tests-together-with-the-code">2. Writing tests together with the code</h3>

<h3 id="3-create-new-environment-for-each-new-project">3. Create new environment for each new project</h3>

<h3 id="4-work-on-personal-project-for-a-couple-of-hours-per-week">4. Work on personal project for a couple of hours per week</h3>

<h3 id="1-journaling">1. Journaling</h3>

<h3 id="1-ask-for-help-when-stalled">1. Ask for help when stalled</h3>

<p>You can create lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple bulleted lists</li>
  <li>Like this one</li>
  <li>Are cool</li>
</ul>

<p>And:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Numbered lists</li>
  <li>Like this other one</li>
  <li>Are great too</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The theme also supports markdown tables:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Author</th>
      <th>Supports tables?</th>
      <th>Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Duet Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>$49</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Index Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>$49</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Journal Jekyll Theme</td>
      <td>Jekyll Themes</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
      <td>$49</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And footnotes<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which link to explanations<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> at the bottom<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of the page<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You can throw in some horizontal rules too:</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="image-galleries">Image galleries</h3>

<p>Here’s a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg" />
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg" />
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg" />
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg" />
</div>

<p>Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we’ve made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"gallery"</span> <span class="na">data-columns=</span><span class="s">"3"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/images/demo/demo-square.jpg"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!</em></p>

<p>Change the number inside the ‘columns’ setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="image-carousels">Image carousels</h3>

<p>Here’s another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.</p>

<p>A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won’t scroll down to find it half way through your images.</p>

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg" />
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg" />
</div>

<h3 id="what-about-videos">What about videos?</h3>

<p>Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/203710832" width="640" height="288" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
